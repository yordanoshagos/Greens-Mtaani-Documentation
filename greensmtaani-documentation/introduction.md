## Overview

Greens Mtaani is a digital platform designed to empower informal grocery vendors in Kenya, known as **Mama Mboga**, by connecting them with tech-savvy customers, particularly the youth. The platform bridges the gap between traditional vendors and modern consumers through a dual-application approach:

- **Progressive Web App (PWA) for Mama Mboga Vendors:**  
  Manage inventory, process orders, and track sales.

- **Mobile App for Customers:**  
  Browse products, create nutrition-based meal plans, join group orders, and make convenient payments.

The platform aims to enhance vendor efficiency, boost sales, reduce food waste, and promote local economic participation by expanding market access for Mama Mboga.
